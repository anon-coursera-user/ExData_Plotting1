This repository is forked from https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1
as an assignment for the Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis Class, which is
part of the "Data Science" Specialization From Johns Hopkins University.  

This assignment uses data from the "Individual household electric power 
consumption Data Set" from the UC Irvine Repository.  Details are available
from the master version of this repository.  

The root directory contains four png image files (plot1.png, plot2.png, 
plot3.png, plot4.png), each representing a different plot from the dataset.  
The plots are to be compared to the corresponding class prototype images 
in the "folder" subdirectory.  

The root directory also contains four corresponding R files (plot1.R,
plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R), which contain scripts used to generate the four 
corresponding png plot files.  Each R file includes code for reading the data 
table and extracting the relevant information, as specified in the class 
assignment instructions (viewable at the master repository).  

Each of the R files generates the same data table (as an R object named "dt").
Therefore, after initially creating the table from one of the files, one 
can simply run the plotting portion of the code from the other files without 
having to re-generate the table.
